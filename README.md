# CS3420 - Priority Inversion Protocols & Capacitance Meter

This is a fully functional implementation of the Non-Preemptive Protocol (NPP), Highest Lock Protocol (HLP),
and Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP) Priority Inheritance Protocols written in C.

Moreover, the code also serves as a capacitance meter on the FRDMK16F Board.

This was my final project for Cornell's CS3420 - Embedded Systems.
